    "\nNo, it's not selfish to ask your friend not to smoke weed when you're together. It's reasonable to make boundaries clear & your friend should respect them. Be flexible if your friend uses weed, but also respect your preferences.",
    "\nIt's understandable that your boyfriend is upset with you for not informing him of your decision. While it's normal to want to be kept in the loop, remember the placebo pill is inert and doesn't offer any contraceptive value.

Take responsibility, maintain open communication, and remind him of other measures taken to prevent pregnancy; this might provide reassurance.",
    "\n \nYou may have a case for lawsuit against the hairdresser; consult a lawyer experienced in consumer protection or business law for advice. You could also pursue other legal remedies or file a complaint with the state board of cosmetology. Keep your receipts as evidence and take action to prevent this from happening to others.",
    "\nI understand this is hard for you and could make it easy to let doubt take over. You're entitled to hurt and betrayal over suspicions of cheating. Taking a paternity test could both now and in the future cause a lot of harm. If the baby turns out to be yours, your trust in your wife is broken. If not, your marriage will be in jeopardy and it would be hard to keep raising the baby as yours. Consider consequences carefully before taking the test if it could destroy your marriage. If possible, try talking calmly to your wife about your concerns and see if a resolution can be reached without the test.",

Acknowledge his disappointment, show that you value his happiness.",
    "\nSounds like your family's view of loyalty is conflicting with your own values, making it hard and confusing. Consider talking to them and explain that while you're loyal, you don't want to take the fall for her legally.

Fortunately, there are resources available: autism-specific support groups, local parent support groups (in-person and online), and social media/other digital sites.

Remember that making friends takes time, so be patient and don't give up. Good luck!",
    " Given your anxiety around others, it's understandable that you feel uncomfortable when your coworker interrupts.

But if he's not willing to make changes, consider whether this relationship can be healthy and fulfilling.",

Talk and make it clear that it's important to have a steady income so you can plan for the future. If he's still resistant, consider your long-term goals; leaving the relationship is an option. Talk to a counselor or friend for a different perspective. It's okay to be frustrated.",
    "\nIt can be hard to tell a friend bad news, and it sounds like you're in a tricky spot. Be honest and gentle when you tell her - let her know you are there for her and will help her through it.

You are valuable and will get through this. Good luck.",

Wishing you and your family the best during this challenging time.",
    "\nIt's hard to feel like you can't have something with a girl because of your penis size, but know that you're still a great person regardless.

Opportunities come up unexpectedly; keep faith in yourself and eventually things will fall into place.",

    "\nI understand wanting to add a 3rd bathroom, but with money a factor, we need to prioritize home improvements, especially the past-life-expectancy water heater & HVAC sys. Replacing these must be our priority before other improvements are made- they are essential. If we replace those, then we can consider the extra bathroom.

Ultimately, it's your decision, but try to be understanding and provide support when needed.",
    "\nYour transgender son's friend should be treated with respect and kindness, no differently than other young people you know.
