        "Question": "How do I tell my coworker to stop bothering me every single time I'm on my break trying to eat?\nTitle. I have extreme anxiety being seen eating and I always pick a time slot for my break that nobody else claims. Everyone respects this and leaves me alone in the break room except for one coworker who, nearly every time without fail, comes in when I am approximately 2-3 minutes into my meal and lingers talking about random things. I immediately lose my ability to eat the moment he walks in and by the time he leaves my break is over and I have to return to work starving. I am starting to get really upset by this but I have no idea how to bring it up or ask for his understanding and cooperation without coming across as a weird mentally fragile idiot. I thought he would eventually notice I stop eating whenever he visits and get the hint but he hasn't. I feel so stupid about this but it's really starting to effect me. I don't want to hurt his feelings but I need to be able to eat to get through the day. What do I say? How do I approach? Should I just start eating lunch in my car?",

I\u2019ll talk to you after!\u201d\n\nBut I don\u2019t think you have the right to boot someone out of what I assume is a *shared* break room. Everyone\u2019s got a right to be in there, if they work there. If you need total solitude, I would find somewhere else to eat.\n\nI\u2019d also recommend seeking professional help to move through this anxiety.",

        "Question": "Do I tell my friend she dresses inappropriately for her age and size?\nI want to start this post by saying I\u2019m not passing judgment on my friend, but I would want to know personally if my attire was considered inappropriate for my body or for the venue or audience. \n\nMy husband and I belong to a social organization for couples. A few months ago we recommended two married friends of ours who I will call Mark and Lisa for membership. We invited them for a meet and greet with other members one evening at an upscale lounge. \n\nLisa likes to dress very sexy and youthful. She is 60 years old, on the heavier side, and has very large breast implants that she can never seem to keep inside her clothes. She showed up to the evening wearing platform flip flops and a semi-see-through beach romper that left nothing to the imagination. When the evening was over, several members shared their feedback and gave her a hard \u201cno\u201d for membership. Some cited a \u201cpersonality conflict\u201d but others stated that they found her appearance and dress to be \u201ctrashy\u201d and \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201ccontradictory to the public persona our group is trying to establish.\u201d  Needless to say they did not become members. \n\nI love my friend. She is kind, funny, hardworking, and would give you the shirt off her back (no pun intended). I don\u2019t judge her for her clothing choices but I do feel uncomfortable sometimes when we hang out, husbands in tow, and she has yet another (entirely preventable) wardrobe malfunction. Do I tell her how wildly inappropriate this is?  Or do I bite my tongue and accept her and her fashion choices?  Thanks.",

        "Aswer": "At 60 years old I'm sure your friend is well aware of social norms and just doesn't care about fitting into them. If you are personally uncomfortable by something she does, you can tell her but be respectful. For example if you're just not interested in seeing nudity, tell her you are uncomfortable with seeing nudity but do not pass it off as a judgment on her. This is entirely your issue, don't project it onto her.",

        "Aswer": "Well Aiden is a huge asshole here so you should do the right thing and protect Maddie.

If you have to pick between the asshole and the victim, protect the victim.",

        "Question": "My sister (F56) is angry with me (F51) for buying my nephew (M18) Plan B, and I've been getting harassed and accused of being inappropriate for it.\nI (F51) live with my husband Brian (M55) only around half an hour away from my sister Lisa (F56), BIL Harold (M55), and nephew Robby (M18). Robby's in his senior year of high school and he's honestly always been a good kid. I love that little brat.\n\nHowever, a few nights ago, I was in the middle of watching cobra kai while Brian was at work. I get a frantic call from Robby. I'll spare the details but he said that he had no money and was in emergency need of Plan B for his girlfriend (F18). He begged me not to tell his parents, and I agreed to it. It's worth noting that he doesn't have a car just yet, and apparently neither does his girlfriend. The kid was freaking out and screaming on the phone, so I took some time to calm him down and reassure him that his future was not ruined and everything was going to be okay.\n\nI went to the nearby CVS and even bought two Plan Bs in case this happens again in the future, and drove down to Robby. My sister and BIL were out for the night, and Robby couldn't thank me enough. I told him not to mention it and also advised him to stay careful in the future. Robby begged me to keep this between us, and I agreed to spare him embarrassment. Unfortunately, I got an angry call from Lisa the next morning, and she had found the other Plan B in Robby's bathroom drawer while she was cleaning the bathroom. She said it was out of line for me to go and do that behind her back, and that I should've told her and Harold. I said that Brian was freaking out and I didn't want to embarrass him or make him feel bad, but Lisa said I was an AH for interfering with her parenting, and that me \"advising him to stay careful in the future\" was an inappropriate thing to say to my own nephew. It's literally gotten to a point where Harold and even a couple of Lisa's friends have been messaging me. I haven't even told Brian about this to keep Robby's word. I wasn't judging him at all, I really was just trying to help.\n\nSince then, I've still been getting messages from Lisa, Harold, and their friends. I haven't responded to a single one, and I even posted to AITA about this before it got taken down. I got a lot of advice on giving Robby the talk, but I'm extremely worried about how inappropriate that's just going to look. But at the same time, I fear that Robby might be uneducated on this stuff, as Lisa and Harold have honestly always been weird about this. Where do I go from here?",

Expect pushback for awhile.  BTW what is your sister doing talking family business over with her friends?  If this stuff continues her son could get really annoyed with her, not to mention her sister.\n\nI would add a gift of condoms to Robby for your next visit.  (I am sure it is not a good idea but if you could get him some...)\n\nAlso, just in case it is appropriate, I am older than your sister.",

        "Question": "My dad thinks my girlfriend is ugly\nA few months ago I met a lovely girl , we started dating and I showed a picture of her to my dad , little did I know that his reaction would hurt me so much , he looked at her picture for the first time and  felt repulsive ,  \" she looks like a maid servant \" is what uttered from his mouth . And I was shocked I wanted to shout at him in anger but kept my cool . Fast forward to today I'm still dating her and he's telling me that I should find somebody better looking , she is also 5 years elder to me and he thinks that she is taking advantage of me because I'm gullible and naive.  He believes that most of the decisions I've taken in life are dumb ..... my dad is a really great guy but I didn't know  he would react this way , he reasons with me saying ,  he wants what's right for me and I should look for someone with a better looking face, I feel so let down . He constantly reminds me about this every day to a point where I'm now questioning my own decision about dating her . I love her, but this thing keeps nagging me every day, and I'm not sure what to do. I'm scared to even introduce her to my dad . \nWhat would you do if you were in my shoes , and how would you guys handle it ?. Do you think it's bad dating someone 5 years older? I'm 24, and she's 29 .",

        "Aswer": "I\u2019m a 42 yr old dad. I have a 22 yr old son. I was bitching at him one day to do something with his life. He was going from dead end job to dead end job. He would come home and tell me or complain about his job. I didn\u2019t want to hear it or listen to it. I just wanted him to find a job. He was trying to figure him self out. His response was \u201cI can never make you happy\u201dand I stopped and realized and thought about what he said to me that day. I still remember it clearly. He was right he can\u2019t make me happy only I can make myself happy and only he can make himself happy. And only you can make your happy. You will never be able to make your dad happy and your not on this planet to make him happy. If he can\u2019t do it on his own it\u2019s because he has issues that he needs to work on, like myself. My son and I are now in a better place. He got a job at a gym and I enjoy talking to him now because he is not complaining no more. He is having fun with his life and that\u2019s all I ever wanted for him. If your dad can\u2019t understand that you have to do what you have to do to make your life count and make it the way you want to live it. It\u2019s your life not his and we only get one shot at it. If you live that girl who gives a fuck as long as you and her are happy together. You are the one who is gonna share your life with her not your dad. You have to be able to please your self before you can please others. When you get that he will envy you because he won\u2019t know how to get what you have. He won\u2019t tell you but it\u2019s true. Hopefully you do the right thing for yourself and your girl. Good luck",
