        "Question": "Is it weird to semi-regularly talk to your sister\u2019s boyfriend?\nI\u2019m tired of explaining this but again tonight my boyfriend said it was weird \u201chow much\u201d I talk to my sisters boyfriend, we\u2019ll just say K for brevity. First off, we talk like 2-3 times a week and it\u2019s a few texts that he usually leaves on delivered for days.I\u2019ve known K for like 6 years at this point, even rented an apartment with him and my sister for a bit last year. And I have never, literally never thought about him in any more than a platonic way. I just don\u2019t see him that way. And the thought of doing anything w him makes my skin crawl. Yet my mother, sister, and my boyfriend have acted suspicious and insinuated I liked him multiple times over the years. I don\u2019t want to cut someone off that I genuinely enjoy talking to, but I also don\u2019t want to make my sister or boyfriend uncomfortable by making them feel like I\u2019m doing something shady.\n\nPossible solutions: Block him, don\u2019t block him, talk even less than we already do. But I feel the problem would remain and I\u2019d lose a good friend",

I know it does nothing whether I took it or not. What he\u2019s upset about is my decision to not take it without telling him. What I don\u2019t understand is why this is such a big deal given all the previous factors AND it being a placebo pill.",

        "Question": "should I(f32) sue hairdresser for not refunding $140\nLong story short, I went into a salon to dye my hair. They said, \"we can dye it that color, no problem, no bleach will be used.\" After dyeing it, my hair came out two very different colors. Then they apply something in my hair. I ask what it is and, it's bleach. I express how much I didn't want that and that and how dare they just put it on my hair without telling me even after it was agreed that bleach wouldnt be used etc. They're like, \"oh you'll be fine\" and then proceeded to dye my hair a second time after the bleach. I look like a clown now with different colors on my hair (orange at the root and brownish red at the body). But the worst of it all is that I have bleach in my hair and I'm upset that my hair will never be the same. I will have to keep cutting it until the damaged bleached hair is gone. I have curly hair so my curls will most likely not be the same also. \n\nI wanted a refund for this experience. These stylist did whatever they wanted to me. Bleached my hair and dyed it twice in 1 day. Instead the stylist and the owner start yelling at me telling me they can't refund me and that I'm wasting their time and that the most they could do for me is give me some type of moisturizing treatment the next time I come in. (They are so clueless) I explain that I'm never coming back and leave with damaged hair, orange roots, and redish/brown hair, a lousy blowout, an uneven trim, and the delight of being shouted at by two extremely unprofessional ladies. Not to mention I paid $140 for this nightmare.\n\nI spoke to friends they're all in shock of such an experience and they warn me that in a couple of months, my hair might fall out bc of the bleach \ud83d\ude22 . I am considering suing this business. What are your thoughts?",

        "Aswer": "Wow I'm so sorry you experienced this, that is very unprofessional. Just to calm your anxiety. I have curly hair as well, and have bleached it more than I would like to admit. You will see some breakage at the ends but I can assure you it's not going to fall out. Use a deep conditioning treatment if it seems damaged, gradually trim the ends rather than just cutting it all, there is no reason you should have to lose your length and your money. You could take it to small claims but I feel in the long run it would be worth more of your energy than it's worth. If it is a corporation call and make a complaint on the salon specifically those ladies, we don't need people like that in the industry, they can have their license revoked. I know a lot of people are against doing their hair at home, but I personally do because of an experience similar to this, and I did attend cosmetology school.  Your roots are much lighter because they take bleach the fastest. Go to Sally's get a toner and developer of your shade choice  I would recommend like a burgundy shade a little darker than the ends of your hair and just do the roots, it will give you a nice ombre affect. If you do decide to do  a dye at home, feel free to reach out with the look you were going for and I can offer more advice and walk you through it.",

They\u2019re my world and honestly I\u2019ve been beating myself up even having these thoughts but recently I\u2019ve doubted if she\u2019s really my biological daughter. We have similarities but there are certain things that have me second guessing. My wife and I both have green eyes I\u2019m mixed and she\u2019s Italian and American. My baby has brown eyes I know it\u2019s a possible for two green eyed parents to have a brown eyed baby but I\u2019ve read it\u2019s rare. \n\nA few years back I had to travel for work and I had my suspicions of my wife cheating but the thought alone brought me to tears. I discussed it with her and she assured me she was loyal to me. She has cheated in her previous relationship but I didn\u2019t want to judge based on that because she was in high school and we\u2019ve all done dumb shit we regret as kids. \n\nI have discussed my concerns with her and to say I caused an argument would be an understatement. She got extremely upset and asked me how I could insinuate that she would ever cheat on me or that my baby isn\u2019t mine. I\u2019ve spoken to her in the past ab my doubts and she told me she would never cheat. I brought it up again and said I had my doubts but I\u2019ll drop it and apologized. She got very defensive and started crying saying \u201cI guess you want a paternity test since you don\u2019t believe me\u201d. I said no but after speaking with my family about it I think I may want one just to clear my mind. If she\u2019s mine I\u2019ll hate myself for ever being doubtful but if she\u2019s not I still haven\u2019t thought about the consequences that can bring. She is my daughter and I love her no matter what but what will that do to my marriage. \n\nThis has caused me so much internal conflict and I\u2019ve spent nights crying thinking I could be making the biggest mistake of my life. If anyone has any advice or has been in a similar situation from mine or my wife\u2019s perspective it would be greatly appreciated.",

        "Aswer": "Okay, my advice? Take 3 steps back!\n\nI understand your doubts, the might be valid but when focusing on just eye color you have about a 25% change of that happening (a lot of other factors come in but it's a ballpark) that's the same as flipping heads twice in a row... Happens all the time!\n\nFirst: Before you do anything decide what you would do if the child isn't yours. Are you actually leaving? Or would you stay regardless?\n\nThere was a story on Reddit lately from a MIL that did the testing for the couple and it broke the guys heart because it was a SA baby and he really didn't want to know so he could keep pretending it was his. \n\nIf you stay regardless I can imagine it being worse if you would know she isn't yours. \n\nLeaving would be a valid choice, let's get that clear. However you need to decide before you do the test what the results will mean for you, because knowing may hurt you more than not knowing.\n\nSecond: get couples counseling, recently heard a story where after a good talk through a therapist both partners were on the same page (and got the test). Where your feelings are valid so are your wife's feelings. And finding a middle ground while both coming from a place of hurt is (almost) impossible. \n\nThird: if you really can't live without knowing and you can't find middle ground on this test, your relationship is already over. You will either resent yourself for not pushing, your partner for not agreeing or she will resent you for doing it anyway. Resentment is a top indicator (iirc even the number 1 indicator) for a failing relationship. Realize NOW if you really need that resentment in your life (in whatever shape) and act accordingly. \n\nBut, if you are ending the relationship anyway, might as well get the test through a court before paying child support.",

So I\u2019m guy in my 20s who grew up REALLY religious. As a kid we had a close family friend who I\u2019d spend many nights at his house and he at mine. On a few occasions his older cousin in her teens baby sat us when our parents went out or did events with our church. His cousin was also a member of our church and his family had a lot of prestige within our parish. \n\nWith that as the backdrop, when she would baby sit us she\u2019d let us play and do whatever. But after a while she would call us down to the family computer and porn would be one. She\u2019d have her hand in her pants and call us over. She\u2019d then have me and my friend do things to each other, to her, and she\u2019d do it back to us. It felt good to me but I knew it was wrong, even at 9 years old. She told us not to tell anyone or else our parents would get kicked out of the church. \n\nThis same pattern went on when I was well into my teens until we no longer needed a baby sitter. During puberty this was especially confusing because I didn\u2019t like men but was forced to do sex acts on my friend. Adding to that, i also lost my virginity to her and felt so impure. I didn\u2019t date anyone in HS because of this. I felt undeserving of love and confused about my sexuality. \n\nI experimented plenty when I went off to college and don\u2019t really have ties to the faith anymore. There is still a level of catholic guilt that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever escape but that\u2019s not all that present in my thoughts these days. The first girl I opened up to about my past left me because I was \u201cwith a man\u201d and I just don\u2019t know that I ever will be willing to be vulnerable like that again. \n\nI guess the reason for this post is to ask if anyone out there has had a similar experience and how you manage? I\u2019ve done therapy in the past but can\u2019t afford it at the moment. \n\nI also want to explore my sexuality further but have a lot of trust issues. Is there a place on Reddit to do so?

Not many black people here, and the ones that are here are mostly from Somalia, a Muslim country, and most of them don't speak much English. I met some Somalian people a few years ago, but a lady I used to talk to a lot now says I should get back with my abusive ex because raising a baby without him goes against God, and I'm gross for not being married before sex. That's probably most of their culture's opinions. I'm so tired of religion being used against me and racist white people making me feel like dirt. I should move, but I don't know where I can go where I'd be welcome. I'm not trying to get with another man. I just want friends so I don't go insane.

Everyone respects this and leaves me alone in the break room except for one coworker who, nearly every time without fail, comes in when I am approximately 2-3 minutes into my meal and lingers talking about random things. I immediately lose my ability to eat the moment he walks in and by the time he leaves my break is over and I have to return to work starving. I am starting to get really upset by this but I have no idea how to bring it up or ask for his understanding and cooperation without coming across as a weird mentally fragile idiot. I thought he would eventually notice I stop eating whenever he visits and get the hint but he hasn't. I feel so stupid about this but it's really starting to effect me. I don't want to hurt his feelings but I need to be able to eat to get through the day. What do I say? How do I approach? Should I just start eating lunch in my car?",

I fell into a horrible depression, that kind that makes not to be able to eat, sleep, stay alone. He was not supportive and cricitized me for taking medication and not doing things to get better. That was just a month or two. He also confessed that has thought about separation and couldnt stand the situation with me being depressed, because he was feeling ok and wanted someone that motivates him to be productive and do things. Also he left me alone after a panick attack at a doctor's appointment (I also had health issues, this being the main reason for my depression), because it was his lunch break and wanted to get back home to eat.\n\nFast forward I recovered quickly and forgave him. After 3 months he wanted again to separate because we had a routine and he didnt feel challanged by the relationship. We stayed together.\n\nFast forward again after 6 months he wanted again to separate and start telling that he doesnt know what he wants. He also said he wanted separation and after 5 min said he didnt. We stayed together.\n\nAgain fast forward 2 months I felt he  has changed behaviour and asked him if moving together was still on the table as we decided a month ago. He said no, I am not the girl he sees his future with and also he has seen his high school love with whom he had been in a \"relationship\" for 3 weeks and compared feelings and the ones for her were stronger. I broke up with him.\n\nHe begged me to stay, promised he will change, came to see me in the hospital, was extremely nice to me, said to move together. I forgave him.\n\nFast forward 2 weeks later(he was very nice and caring)  I made a joke that I want to eat meat again (we both dont eat meet). He said he wanted to break up, that he had these thoughts about not knowing what we wants again. After 5 min he regreted and wanted to stay together. I left.\n\nNow he tells me to forgive him that he loves me and doesnt know why he behaves like this and he is depressed.\n\n\nOpinions are welcomed:)",

        "Question": "Was I groomed by my teacher at 15? My therapist says I was. I\u2019m now 24 and the teacher is suddenly emailing me.\nThis is my first time using Reddit, so apologies in advance if i\u2019m doing anything incorrectly and sorry if this is too long.\n\nI was very close to a teacher at school when i was 15/16. She was a woman (29) and so am I. I suffered badly from panic attacks, anxiety, grief and depression. She would always comfort me and help me through it. She was caring and very good at teaching her subject. But some of her behaviour left me feeling very confused and uncomfortable. \n\nShe would discuss her personal life with me, including details about her relationship with her boyfriend and her sex life. She\u2019d say to me that i was one of her favourites, compliment my appearance sometimes and touch me often - like cradling my face or stroking my hair. She\u2019d often stare at me intently during class/around the school and mistakenly say my name when talking to another student or compliment me to other students.\n\nI found all of this really overwhelming and her intimidating. This led to me getting palpitations around her, feeling sick, weak/shaky or like i\u2019d pass out in her class. I couldn\u2019t eat my lunch before her lessons because i was afraid of how her behaviour made me feel. I always thought I just had a crush on her because she was a great teacher, attractive, and young. It made me question my sexuality at the time. \n\nAfter I left school in 2015, we stayed in touch for a few years through her school email very occasionally. I then found out that she\u2019d left the school and heard nothing from her for 4 years.\n\nI\u2019m now 24 and suddenly a few days ago, she emailed me through her personal email and I was shocked. I got the same feelings of nausea, shakiness and breathlessness that I got in her class. She said in the email that because it was International Women\u2019s Day, she thought of me and wanted to check how I am (odd?). She told me that she\u2019d left the school and also left teaching and she hopes i\u2019m \u201ccontinuing to be amazing\u201d.\n\nWhen i told my therapist about this all, she said that I had been groomed by my teacher at 15 and I was made to feel special by her, which then made me feel like I had a crush on her. \n\nI\u2019m finding it difficult to process because i thought this teacher was a good person and someone i missed, looked up to and loved. Am I in denial that I was groomed? Did she take advantage of me? I feel like what if I\u2019m making things up and the lines are blurry. The idea of \u201cbeing groomed\u201d makes me feel very upset, angry, almost \u2018dirty\u2019 and traumatised :(",

My gf always wanted a third bathroom to be added which isnt a problem to me, because the two bathrooms are in the middle and basement floor respectively. \n\nUpon getting the house inspection done, it has been revealed that the water heater, and hvac system is 3-4 years past its  life expectancy and i would like to have that replaced before all other improvements are made. To me, it takes more of a priority over a bathroom because #1, a third bathroom isnt absolutely needed, Its more of a want imo and #2, the other two bathrooms have been renovated and look very good aesthetically. \n\nMy gf doesnt look at the hvac situation as seriously as i do and is dead set on this bathroom.

        "Question": "Career Advice\nI have been working for Doordash about a year and a half now. I make $900-$1,000 per week after expenses, tax, gas, and food. I work 7 days a week so that means I don\u2019t have time to spend any of the money I make so that basically means I save $900-$1,000 per week. Last year I bought a 3-plex in my hometown right near main street and moved into one of the apartments. The two other apartments cover my mortgage which basically means I pay no rent. When I\u2019m working, I stay home in between orders and play video games. When I get an order, I pause my game, go deliver the order, then come back home. It\u2019s the best job I ever had, and it\u2019s the most money I\u2019ve ever made. I\u2019m 22, guy, degree in pre-med (dropped out of university), no special experience in any sector of employment, basically a nobody. \n\nBut here\u2019s my quandary, right. My family has a hard time to wrap their heads around my job. Actually, they don\u2019t even consider it a real \u201cjob\u201d. So they offered to pay for my schooling if I went and got a DEP in something. I\u2019m not complaining, it\u2019s very generous of them, so I told them I\u2019d get a DEP in electricity, signed up, got admitted, and now I start my course in about 3 months. The thing is, I keep having second thoughts about it, but I don\u2019t want to pull out because it\u2019s kind of a recurring joke that I never finish what I start and always reverse course last minute. It\u2019s just that I love my job and I\u2019m making good money but at the same time I do agree with them that getting a \u201creal\u201d job (electrician) would be to my benefit.

My parents are divorced and my father has primary custody and we are with my mother every other weekend. My twin sister Mia and I are extremely close and always have been. \n\nMia is gay and that\u2019s the main reason my stepfather has been mean to her ever since he met her but Saturday he crossed a line. I\u2019ve talked to my father about how my stepfather behaves towards my sister and he\u2019s had multiple conversations with my stepfather telling him to quit some of which have gotten very heated. Most of what he\u2019s been doing is calling her names and being very rude and disrespectful towards her. \n\nSaturday my sister had just gotten out of the shower she had gotten dressed walking out of the upstairs bathroom which is a few steps away from the top of the stairs. My mom and stepfather\u2019s bedroom right beside it. As my sister was walking out of the bathroom she had turned to walk down the stairs when my stepfather came out of the bedroom. He called her a homophobic slur then pushed her from behind and sent her falling down the stairs. \n\nI ran to check on my sister and aside from a broken arm and busted lip she was ok. I then called 911 and asked for the police and an ambulance. The police arrived first and I told them what had happened and they arrested my stepfather for aggravated battery. The ambulance arrived not long after to take my sister to the hospital. I rode in the ambulance with my sister and called our father who met us at the hospital. \n\nMy sister is ok they took X-rays and checked her for other injuries then put a cast on her arm that she\u2019ll get off in about two months. They kept her overnight for observation then sent her home the following morning. So she\u2019s going to be just fine. \n\nSince then my mother has been calling me nonstop and sending me text messages telling me that I ruined her life and should be ashamed for calling 911 and not giving her time to make up a story before taking my sister to the hospital. My father has called my mother and told her to knock it off and that she\u2019s lucky the police handled my stepfather and not him. It\u2019s safe to say that we won\u2019t be having to stay with my mother for awhile if ever and my sister and I both are happy about that.

On top of that I've already missed a lot of school recently, and while he was on his bender I didn't leave my room for 3 days, so I haven't eaten in 3 days, because I obviously didn't want to go out and deal with him screaming and breaking shit, so for that reason alone I think he deserves to be alone for a day.
